        Yesterday I received a follow from a random Twitter user (feels odd to
        call it X within prose). What struck me about this user, at least enough
        to write about it, was the raw and direct presentation of their thoughts
        — both in writing, and in artistic expression. Their
        <a href="https://caseploeg.com/" target="_blank">website</a> is
        partially what inspired my tweet. Even though it is primarily text, it
        has an overwhelming sense of personality to it. More personality, I'd
        argue, than the majority of sites I come across nowadays. I imagine this
        sentiment is what led Paul Graham to write the following in his
        <a href="https://paulgraham.com/reddits.html" target="_blank"
          >recent essay</a
        >
        concerning Reddit:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
          As with all the really great startups, there's an uncannily close
          match between the company and the founders. Steve in particular.
          Reddit has a certain personality — curious, skeptical, ready to be
          amused — and that personality is Steve's.

        Sure it's a little rough around the edges. But it stands tall amongst a
        sea of mundanity. Personality is not just a set of personal traits
        unique to the individual, but also takes shape to anything it touches if
        you allow yourself to be temporarily unbound by the perception of what
        is "normal". Normal isn't interesting. Normal is like everything else. By
        being a conduit of free, unadulterated self-expression, you create
        things that people find more interesting. At varying levels of fidelity,
        personality <b><i>is</i></b> the differentiating factor.

      <p>So go out there and make something uniquely your own. :)</p>
